### DONE:

- Convert Data from IMU into attitudes and angles

- Receive user input through Serial Monitor

- Send signal to motors through ESC and map user input (1000PWM -> 2000PWM)

- Implement basic PID Control
- Make three potentiometers vary the PID gains mapped between 0-1

- (28/06) Redesign and print CAD structure to test 1 degree of freedom: Pitch

- (29/06) Assemble printed parts and try basic testing with BE1306-3100KV motor

- (30/06) Added IMU to frame, finalized connections, mapped controlOutput, managed to make it hold ~horizontal for a few seconds

- (03/07 Week) Implemented PID, filter, and everything else to make model stabilize with 1 motor. Started working on version 1.3 for roll.

- (10/07 Week) Heavily modified version 1.3, three iterations (Designs 1, 2, and 3) can be found atm in Solidworks Parts directory

- (17/07 Week) Finalized version 1.3 Design 3 which is the final hardware version ready for software testing of roll, pitch, and yaw. Also ready for testing with Arduino Mini instead of Arduino
